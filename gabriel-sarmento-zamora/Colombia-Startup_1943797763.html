<p>Hello, all! </p><p>I suggest using the PR FAQ from Amazon as a template for the Combiam launch. Please, find a real example of a PR FAQ from Amazon <a class="external-link" href="https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1529286/files/85944010/download?verifier=olDBsCwHLQ4rQYB44EC2Vo8PXJQPeLtzVwVyvb2O&amp;wrap=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>
</div></div><h3 id="ColombiaStartup-Whyusethisstructure?">Why use this structure? </h3><p>(From Amazon ex-employees)</p><p>Most of Amazon’s major products and initiatives since 2004 have one very Amazonian thing in common—they were created through a process called Working Backwards. </p><p>Usually, in a conventional organization, a press release is written at the end of the product development process. The engineers and product managers finish their work, then “throw it over the wall” to the marketing and sales people, who look at the product from the customer point of view, often for the first time. They’re the ones who write the press release, which describes the killer features and fantastic benefits and is designed to create buzz, capture attention, and, above all, get customers to leap out of their chairs to buy.</p><p>In this standard process, the company works forward. The leaders come up with a product or business that is great for the company, and then they try to shoehorn it into meeting previously unmet customer needs.</p><p>That approach can lead to some undesirable results, Jeff believed. To make his point, he used Sony as a hypothetical example. Suppose Sony decides to introduce a new TV. The sales and marketing group has done its research into customer preferences and market trends (but not necessarily the customer experience) and has determined that Sony should offer a 44-inch TV at a price point of $1,999. The engineering team, however, has been working on the new TV for quite some time, and their focus has been on picture quality, which means higher resolution, and they have not been especially concerned about price point. The TV they come up with will cost $2,000 just to manufacture. So there is no way that the retail price can be $1,999.</p><p>If the two organizations had started the process by writing a press release, they would have had to agree on the features, cost, customer experience, and price. Then they could have worked backwards to figure out what to build, thereby surfacing the challenges they would face in product development and manufacturing.</p><p /><h3 id="ColombiaStartup-PressReleaseComponents">Press Release Components</h3><p>‍</p><p><em><strong>Heading:</strong></em> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. One sentence under the title. </p><p /><p><em><strong>Subheading:</strong></em> Describe the customer for the product and what benefits they will gain from using it. One sentence only underneath the Heading.</p><p /><p><em><strong>Summary Paragraph: </strong></em>Start with the city, media outlet, and your proposed launch date. Give a summary of the product and the benefit.</p><p><em> </em></p><p><em><strong>Problem Paragraph:</strong></em> This is where you describe the problem that your product is designed to solve. Make sure that you write this paragraph from the customer’s point of view. </p><p /><p><em><strong>Solution Paragraph(s):</strong></em> Describe your product in some detail and how it simply and easily solves the customer’s problem. For more complex products, you may need more than one paragraph.</p><p /><p><em><strong>Quotes &amp; Getting Started:</strong></em> Add one quote from you or your company's spokesperson and a second quote from a hypothetical customer in which they describe the benefit they are getting from using your new product. Describe how easy it is to get started, and provide a link to your website where customers can get more information and get started.</p><p>‍</p><h2 id="ColombiaStartup-SAMPLEFAQS"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);">SAMPLE FAQS</span></h2><h3 id="ColombiaStartup-ExternalFAQs(Example,needstobespecific.)">External FAQs (Example, needs to be specific.)</h3><p>Q: What is the price?</p><p>Q: How do I get it?</p><p>Q: How does it work?
